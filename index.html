          <h3>Webben om 5 år</h3>
          <p>
            In 5 year or so, i believe that the web will become much larger than what it is today. If we look back to how it used to be when it was only accesible through a computer, to now where its possible to acces it nearly anywhere you are. In 5 year, those blindspots will probably be covered as well, making it possible to access the internet anywhere, even in far remote places. <br>
Nowadays the web can be accessed almost anywhere, but gaining acces to it when traveling to other countries with your operator etc can lead to many problems and hassles. I believe that in 5 years time, these kind of services will improve making it far easier to gain access even when you are in another country. <br>
Day by day as we learn more and more and go through each day, so does the technology we use. From computers to laptops, from phones to smartphones and the creation of tablets, smartwatch etc, these are the devices we mostly use today to go through the web while on the run to perhaps work or to school. In 5 years time, it will probably not only limited to these devices, perhaps even more comfortable, portable, smarter devices will be created making it far easier to gain access to the web and making our experience with the web far different. <br><br> 

The web itself has been changed from how we use to know it and it will only keep chaning and expanding its usage. An example could be books, news, learning materials, information. Things you have used to go to the library to find can now all be found in the web. I believe that books used for teaching in school will be replaced by the web. Even this course we are undertaking are using services and knowledge accessed through the web that some peoples have created and put on the web. It is far smoother and no student can ever use the excuse of forgetting bringing their math book. Not only that, old dirty tainted old books would not be needed anymore, all you gotta do is access the web, the web will never get dirty like books do. <br>
In 5 years time, whether its company promoting their own company, reading the news while you're on the buss, learning materials and so on will be more and more done through the web. Even though it might not entirely remove the usage of paper or books, a great amount of it would probably be decreased (think of mother nature). <br>
There are still people, mostly the older generation that are still unfamiliar with the web and doesnt even know how to use it. I think 5 years time might not be enough time to change that, but as time goes on, there will be a time when no one doesnt know the web is or how to use it. <br>
It is impossble to predict how the web will be in 5 years time, as many things can happen and many genius peoples will keep create things that will blow us away. But something that is for sure, is that the web will keep expand and the usage of it will only be more and more.
